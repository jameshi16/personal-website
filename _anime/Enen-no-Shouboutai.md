**WARNING**: Late & short review. I don't personally enjoy action anime, but this was quite a fun watch.

Something about fire, a tragic enough backstory to most characters, and the dynamics of the quite diverse crew of characters (there's a kind but evil guy in the anime) elevates the anime to just another action-focused series.

Although, I must say that I didn't expect a scientific explanation during one of the series' climax fights - it seemed unnecessary. It's like putting a subtitle, like "You are my nakama", and then adding a "TL Note: Nakama is friend in Japanese"; all we need to know at that moment is that incredible feats are being achieved, and the explanations can probably come later.

Nevertheless, this was a fun watch - if you like :fire:, and want to see people duke it out with flames, check this one out. The community over at [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net/anime/38671/Enen_no_Shouboutai) seems to like it.

Happy coding
