**Warning:** late & short review. _Another_ isekai anime! This time, there's no OP hero, but a girl obsessed with books.

Yet another combination that seems to work well; the execution salvaged the anime from my original perception that "this is just another isekai anime, I don't really want to watch it". Do note that I lied in my previous paragraph, about the "OP" part. You'll see what I mean if you watch the anime till the end.

For the remainder of the anime, we see that the main character try to hide her identity as she "invents" new products that she brought over from her old world, set a goal for her entrepreneurship ideals, but give it up for a more realistic plan that factored in her very (second) life.

In a nutshell, this was a refreshing watch; a young girl with the tendencies of a entrepreneur in another world is a concept you simply don't experience often.

Happy coding
