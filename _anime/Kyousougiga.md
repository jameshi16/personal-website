**WARNING**: Late review. I honestly didn't even remember I watched this anime until I rewatched segments of the last episode.

Essentially, it is about a main character girl trying to find her parents, which ropes in even more characters that were "siblings" with different traits (and entirely different species), all with their own ways of reaching their original world to find their parents.

While it may seem convoluted, at least it was somewhat entertaining, and had a proper closure - i.e. the whole anime represents the whole story. Watch it on a boring night, if you want to.

Happy Coding
