**Warning:** late & short review. We're already at the fourth season! Boku no Hero Academia is a shounen anime, which I am not normally interested in, but I've vested too much time to ignore.

And well, Boku no Hero 4th season was a pretty good season; we even got a cliffhanger at the end to build suspense for the next season. The most memorable moment in the season was probably the climax scene; one can say that the aftermath caused a reshuffling of the cast cabinet, and the dynamics of the characters has changed somewhat.

Let's see what Season 5 has got in store for us.

Happy coding
