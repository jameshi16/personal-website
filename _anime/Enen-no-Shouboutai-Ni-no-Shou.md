This season has more world-building, expanding the possibilities for future instalments of Fire Force. There is ample character development, even in unexpected characters; the fights are engaging to watch, accompanied by modern audiovisuals.

At the same time, there isn't much to comment about this season; perhaps the lack of impact Fire Force Season 2 has would have docked more points on its rating, but I believe that this was intentionally done as a precursor to something greater in Season 3.

If you have other anime to watch on your bucket list, it might be better to pursue those first; Fire Force Season 2 might be something to binge when Fire Force Season 3 is announced.

Happy Coding
