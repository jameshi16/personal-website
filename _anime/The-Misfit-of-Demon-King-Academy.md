**Warning:** Lasting impression based review

You know what, for what I assumed would be a cookie-cutter harem anime, this sure has some lasting effects.

I think one of the main reasons for this is because of how complete the anime is; The Misfit of the Demon King encompasses all the right factors for story-telling, and goes through arcs in a fast-paced yet understandable manner.

Apart from the main character (due to obvious reasons of being a freaking ancient demon lord), the character building for the main cast was quite exquisite. This combined with the contrast of the main character's unshakeable ideals makes the anime quite refreshing to watch, even though the OP main character troupe has been replayed across many anime in the recent seasons.

This anime should stick in your mind for a while after you watch it; if you don't mind watching anime with no inherent value yet enjoyable, add Misfit of the Demon King into your to-watch list.

Happy Coding
