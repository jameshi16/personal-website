**Warning:** Late & short review. It's _another_ isekai anime! Studios nowadays seem to ride the wave to try creating "unique" isekai anime, like the one about the [Shield Hero](/anime/The-Rising-of-the-Shield-Hero/), or the one about a [Mother](https://myanimelist.net/anime/38573/Tsuujou_Kougeki_ga_Zentai_Kougeki_de_Ni-kai_Kougeki_no_Okaasan_wa_Suki_Desu_ka), or the one about a [cheat magician](https://myanimelist.net/anime/37744/Isekai_Cheat_Magician).

So, what's so different about Cautious Hero?

Not so much; it's literally about a cautious hero in an isekai setting. Like any other industry, trends will cause a flux of "creative" spin-offs; for instance, take the "-as-a-Service" suffix. People adopt the suffix left and right, and things like Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), Dog walks as a service (DWaaS), Infrastructure-as-a-Service (CaaS) and heck, even Service as a Service (SaaS) surface.

Applying the same logic for the current Isekai trend, instead of a Shield Hero, or a Hero with a Mother, or a Hero that is extremely overpowered, or a [OP slime Hero](/anime/That-Time-I-Got-Reincarnated-as-a-Slime/), we instead have an OP but careful hero.

And this combination kind of works, especially after the main character's backstory is explained in the anime. Something about an overpowered character using his most powerful spell on a Level 1 slime makes me remember the days where I farmed EXP just to cheese dungeons in MMORPGs.

If you've got nothing else to watch, you can give Cautious Hero a try; it's surprisingly bearable despite the overwhelming influx of isekai anime from the industry.

Happy coding
