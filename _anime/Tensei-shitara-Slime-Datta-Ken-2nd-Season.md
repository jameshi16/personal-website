Another great entry to Winter 2021 anime! Tensura was a well-esteemed Isekai anime, which I [reviewed](/anime/That-Time-I-Got-Reincarnated-as-a-Slime/). Despite staying close to the nature of a Isekai anime, it manages to stand out thanks to the humor, good world development and an above average character development.

# Story

In this season, we see neighbouring nations starting to take notice of the Jura Tempest Federation. Different nations have different responses, with one nation causing the main conflict of the season due to a corrupt leadership board.

At the beginning of Tensura, Rimuru forbade the monsters from attacking humans; this rule turned against him, causing him to face his current reality as a monster and sparing no sympathy to the humans who wronged him. This very conflict laid the foundations required for the next potential conflict in Season 3, which would likely be one that affects the world itself.

Other things that I care about: story consistency & continuity, plot progression and engagement, they were all green to me. Rimuru maintains his humorous approach to situations, although he almost exploded in rage in one instance. The plot moved forward as Rimuru makes deals with the other nations, and there were enough conflicts to keep the viewers on their toes, improving viewer retention.

All in all, the story was just as good as it was in Season 1.

# Character Development

One of the most surprising things to me was the fact that Daikenja (Rimuru's Great Sage skill) undergone its own Character Development. Despite having no physical form or appearance, Daikenja plays an important role in Tensura - from being the infallible Wikipedia to an auto-battler, to taking care of Rimuru as his consciousness faded into nothingness, it seemed from the onset that Daikenja would be nothing more than a talkative skill that Rimuru could rely upon at any moment. In Season 2, Daikenja experiences _growth_; its behaviour evolved, indirectly improving its relations with Rimuru. In the future, it might be possible that Daikenja would play a pivotal role in the plot, potentially being _sacrificed_ somehow.

Apart from Daikenja, Tensura 2 does not have much to speak of in terms of character development; the season was highly focused on building the world and upgrading Rimuru for the next arc.

# Conclusion

Tensura is a very fun series to watch; its light, comedic nature mixed with its Isekai elements alongside the unique elements in its pretext makes the anime a relaxing watch on a cold Saturday night. I look forward to see what Season 3 has in store for me; particularly, I want to see the new characters introduced towards the end of the series interacting with the newly powered-up Rimuru.

Happy Coding
