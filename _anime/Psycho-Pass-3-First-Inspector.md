**Warning:** Lasting impression based review

Psycho-Pass 3: First Inspector manages to bring Season 3 to a close via logical storytelling, better-than-before artstyle and easy to understand chorography.

Being in the middle of a series, there is less to be expected of character building and world building, and more of fulfilling the plot points required to move the story forward. Befitting the psychological genre, there are some dilemmas as we explore the newbies of the series, namely Arata, Ignatov and the duo's dynamic with Maya.

Psycho-pass is a staple for all psychological fans, hence, I would recommend it for anyone trying to complete their portfolio.

Happy Coding
