**WARNING**: Late & short review. Yes, I'm a late bloomer to the Parasyte anime, despite being recommended it so many times.

One stellar thing I remember about Parasyte is the character development, and how well it was portrayed with plot devices in the anime. Minor spoilers: When Izumi first gains Migi, he was weak and scrawny, unable to defend himself against bullies; but later on, when a similar bullying incident happens he wipes the floor with them.

The anime is scattered with plenty of these character developments, which builds on top of the entertaining premise that are the man-eating parasites. The plot and story are engaging, which kept me up to 3am at night just to marathon the whole series.

Definitely recommend.

Happy coding
