**Warning**: This review was written 2 months after I watched it, but dude this thing is :bomb:. Also, don't play any of the videos in this post if you don't want to be spoiled.

Demon Slayer is a Shounen anime that took the internet by storm, and for good reason; it's a piece of art. I've said this in previous reviews, but I am not a huge fan of Shounen anime, so why am I singing such high praises? For me, it's two main things: (i) audiovisual mastery and (ii) hype towards any fight.

Let's talk about audiovisual mastery. There is a studio that puts out unlimited money towards making their animations eye-candy to feast upon: that is ufotable. The visuals for this anime is otherworldly and extremely enjoyable to watch. Just look at this animation sequence from the famous episode 19 of the anime:

The background music playing for this scene is astonishingly fitting, with the right transitions playing at the right frame - seriously, if you have no idea what I'm talking about, just watch (and hear) this short clip from Demon Slayer:

<div style="text-align:center"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/brCe7D0vLVE" style="display:block; margin:auto" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><br/></div>

Then, there is the buildup towards the "ultimate action" in a fight. If you ask me, the core of any Shounen fight is the ultimate deciding move - the move where the fight is at it's climax, and the winner/loser can be easily discerned. Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba does this exceptoinally well, especially for fights involving Zenitsu; the OST for him is absolutely on point, and you can feel it in your soul when he unleashes an epic move. If you've already watched the show, you would know what I mean, just look at this clip:

<div style="text-align:center"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ce6dhqGWdrA" style="display:block; margin:auto" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><br/></div>

In short, if you haven't watched Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba yet, you should definitely do it. It's worth the hype :+1:.

Happy Coding,
