**Warning:** Late & short review. Darwin's game has an interesting synopsis, a cool storyline, and every opportunity to be a great anime.

Unfortunately, it's way too edgy. At the start of the anime, the motives of the main character was a series of logical thoughts for a person thrown in the middle of something supernatural, but at the end of the anime, the character development accelerates beyond the speed of light and ruins the otherwise interesting plot.

Watch for the cool storyline, but don't expect too much in the form of engagement and entertainment.

Happy coding
