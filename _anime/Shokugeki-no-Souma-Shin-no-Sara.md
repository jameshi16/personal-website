**Warning:** Late & short review. Heck yeah, Shokugeki no Souma! In the entrepreneurship world, this anime might have been a successful startup.

I've watched Shokugeki no Souma before I ever had an anime section in my blog, and I was thoroughly entertained at the thought that students would have to compete in all things cooking related to earn a spot in the school, move on to the next year, gain possession of club spaces, and expel people from the school.

The fact that the highest decision making authority other than the director is a committee run by students who earn their spots with cooking battles makes me squirm with excitement, enough to try launching a startup to push for a similar specialty-training education system, based on the mastery of the specialization.

Needless to say, the competitive environment portrayed by the anime brings about an engaging story that can be enjoyed by all.

Watch it, it's good.

Happy Coding
