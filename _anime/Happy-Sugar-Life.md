**WARNING**: Late & short review. Not everything is what it seems; I was one of those guys who got bamboozled by the title and upbeat opening song.

The anime isn't half-bad; the most memorable scene that stuck to me after all these months was the ending - it contained a short but impactful enlightenment phase for the main character, which is one of the only pure things in the entire anime. Little did the MC know, but her little pure act caused everlasting damage to those around her.

Other than that, if I was in a position to decide how to adapt Happy Sugar Life, I would go with a cutesy horror RPG maker game - the vibe the anime gives would certainly work there.

Give Happy Sugar Life a watch; it's quite entertaining to say the least.

Happy coding
