**WARNING:** Late & short review. Man, for an anime that was released in 2011, I sure am late to the party.

While I might not admit it, I'm a sucker for the drama genre of anime; you know what I'm talking about. Anime like "Clannad", "Angel Beats!" and "Charlotte" - they're addicting to watch, and for good reason.

A good drama anime has a stellar underlying plot, relationship settings, diverse set of characters and one or two twists that can change the viewer's perception in an instant. You lead the viewers by their nose, only snap their necks at a moment's notice, completely changing the "love-hate" status of a character.

Anohana has the characteristics of a good drama anime; complete with a calm and relaxing opening, complex characters with complex relationship settings, underlying plot that tugs on the heartstrings of viewers, and enough time investment to make every emotional moment count.

In a nutshell, Anohana is a good anime. I recommend it.

Happy Coding
