**Warning:** late & short review. Our gacha money did something! Rejoice fellow FGO players, for our salt amounted to an adaptation of yet another Fate anime!

For those uninitiated, Fate is hands down my favourite series. Hence, I didn't really care that I knew the entire plot from playing the game, and still watched the anime like a true devout follower of the Fate franchise.

I loved every part of it; although, the technicalities of the last battle with Tiamat was, in my book, impossible. Hence, I docked a point, but otherwise this anime would have gotten a 10/10 rating from me. Not biased, of course.

I can't wait for the other adaptations for Camelot and Solomon, they're going to be _epic_.

Play FGO. Watch the anime.

Happy Coding
