**Warning:** Late & short review. Kanata no Astra is a gem of a series, with stellar (haha get it) plot, character development, and enough twist and turns to engage the viewer.

The cast each has their own background story that defines their current personality, being diverse enough that viewers would be able to sympathize with at least one character. Being an anime set in space, the backgrounds, challenges and reactions is in constant flux, keeping the user hooked as the underlying plot progresses.

This anime also completes the entire story and has a proper ending; hence, if you're looking for a good, wholesome watch, do give Kanata no Astra a shot.

Happy Coding
