This anime was recommended to me by a friend of mine, who is an avid fan of the series. He is one to usually drop anime when he is disinterested, and he has dropped _a lot_ of anime. So, this must have been pretty good, right?

Having watched the [first season](https://myanimelist.net/anime/31240/Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu) a while back (in 2016), I've let the initial hype of Re:Zero die within me. What originally hooked me from the first season was how unique the main character's struggle is, which is a result of the unique setting created for the story. Everything else, from the story's conflicts, to how the main character overcomes them eventually is, well, bland, at most.

# Season 2

This is a season that develops story elements and characters, finally introducing the "fabled" ones from Season 1, developing Beatrice and our most mysterious Roswaal. The season also gives us a glimpse into the inner workings of Subaru through a bunch of well-placed story-supported flashbacks.

Unfortunately, this is the one season that lacks the "punch" required for me to give it a higher rating - there is no significant event that would make me go around to recommend this to anybody. While it is true that a deeper lore is established between the characters through Subaru's restarts, often changing who the suspected villain and ally groups are, the season lacks the defining moment that is the climax of a story arc.

I know that this season is only a "Part 1" - there is still a "Part 2" coming soon. Hence, it might be fairer to judge the season as a whole after also watching Part 2 - for now, objectively judging the anime that is considered "complete" according to [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net/anime/39587/Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu_2nd_Season), "Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu 2nd Season" has been mighty underwhelming to watch.

# Conclusion

I cannot recommend a "must-watch" for "Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu 2nd Season" - at least not in its current form. The key is Part 2 - if done right, Part 1 can be justified as having the necessary pre-requisite story, character and scene developments required for a impactful climax.
