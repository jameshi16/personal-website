# James' Personal Website
![Build & Deploy](https://github.com/jameshi16/personal-website/workflows/Build%20&%20Deploy/badge.svg)

This website started as a fork from [Github's Personal Website Repository](https://github.com/github/personal-website).

## Credits
- `assets/styles.scss` modified from [@nikhilraghava](https://github.com/nikhilraghava). Check him out on his [website](https://geekfile.xyz) (we're buddies!).
- `body` styles to prevent scrollbar shifting from [@SpdPnd98](https://github.com/SpdPnd98). His [website](https://modelconverge.xyz) is pretty sick, check him out! (he's also my buddy!)
    - I'm using an alternative inspired by his work: add `width: 100vw; overflow-x: hidden` to the `<body>` tag
