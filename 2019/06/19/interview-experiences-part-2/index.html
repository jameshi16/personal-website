<p>Well; I told you - I would have had quite an experience and be able to make a blog post today.</p>

<p>I wanted to talk about one of the problems that was presented to me during the interview:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>How do you figure out if a linked list is incorrectly looping?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/Linked-List-Loop.gif" style="max-width: 400px; width: 100%; margin: 0 auto; display: block;" alt="A looped linked list"></p>

<p>There are so many possible answers to this solution. I came up with a solution which involves using a <code class="highlighter-rouge">set</code> object to store all the pointers, and check with the set to ensure that there are no duplicates. It’s a really bad algorithm, but I said it to answer the question. The interviewer’s (his) solution was more interesting, and is something that I haven’t encountered before - do keep in mind that I don’t indulge myself into algorithms in my diploma course and free time, because I’m more focused in actually trying to do something than to do it well.</p>

<p>Anyway, his algorithm was like this:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Create two pointers, <code class="highlighter-rouge">Ptr1</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">Ptr2</code>;</li>
  <li>Make <code class="highlighter-rouge">Ptr1</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">Ptr2</code> point at the same element;</li>
  <li>
<code class="highlighter-rouge">Ptr2</code> will advance two steps per iteration, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">Ptr1</code> will advance one step per iteration;</li>
  <li>If any of the two pointers hit <code class="highlighter-rouge">NULL</code>, then the algorithm proves that there are no loops in the linked list;</li>
  <li>
<code class="highlighter-rouge">Ptr1</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">Ptr2</code> will eventually collide in the loop, if neither pointer has hit <code class="highlighter-rouge">NULL</code>, it signifies that there is a loop in the linked list.</li>
</ol>

<p>This blew my mind a little bit, and after hitting <code class="highlighter-rouge">geeksforgeeks.org</code>, this 5 step proceedure I described was actually one part of the Flyod’s Cycle detection algorithm (Flyod’s Cycle detection algorithm is completed in the subsequent steps). What really displaced what little intellectual points I had left in me was the next part:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How do you resolve the incorrectly looping linked list?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>His algorithm was like this:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Set <code class="highlighter-rouge">Ptr2</code> back to the beginning of the linked list;</li>
  <li>Let <code class="highlighter-rouge">Ptr1</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">Ptr2</code> go through the link list at the same speed, at one step per iteration;</li>
  <li>Their first collision <strong>will be</strong> the beginning of the loop.</li>
</ol>

<p>You may ask: wait, why is Step 3 true?</p>

<p>Let’s say <code class="highlighter-rouge">Ptr1</code> travels <code class="highlighter-rouge">x</code> number of nodes within the linked list. This menas that <code class="highlighter-rouge">Ptr2</code> travelled <code class="highlighter-rouge">2x</code> number of nodes before it collides with <code class="highlighter-rouge">Ptr1</code>. What this also implies, is that if you were to let <code class="highlighter-rouge">Ptr1</code> travel another <code class="highlighter-rouge">x</code> number of nodes, it will collide with <code class="highlighter-rouge">Ptr2</code> again, as <code class="highlighter-rouge">x + x = 2x</code>, which is the same distance <code class="highlighter-rouge">Ptr2</code> has travelled. Now, think about the distances travelled by <code class="highlighter-rouge">Ptr1</code>: it needed <code class="highlighter-rouge">x</code> number of nodes to collide with <code class="highlighter-rouge">Ptr2</code> <em>from the start</em> of the linked list, and, by travelling another <code class="highlighter-rouge">x</code> number of nodes, it <em>collides with <code class="highlighter-rouge">Ptr2</code> again</em>. This implies that if I were to have another pointer, called <code class="highlighter-rouge">Ptr3</code>, which travels at the same speed as <code class="highlighter-rouge">Ptr1</code>, with <code class="highlighter-rouge">Ptr1</code> starting at the collision position and <code class="highlighter-rouge">Ptr3</code> starting at the start, then <code class="highlighter-rouge">Ptr1</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">Ptr2</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">Ptr3</code> will collide at the same collision point. Meaning: the first collision point between <code class="highlighter-rouge">Ptr1</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">Ptr3</code> will signify the problematic node. If we were to make <code class="highlighter-rouge">Ptr1</code> travel through the whole loop again, checking the next node pointed by <code class="highlighter-rouge">Ptr1</code> to <code class="highlighter-rouge">Ptr3</code>, we can find the culprit causing the loop in the linked list, and route it to null.</p>

<p>In the above chunk of text, you realize that <code class="highlighter-rouge">Ptr2</code> is only used to prove that <code class="highlighter-rouge">Ptr1</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">Ptr3</code>’s first collision is the point where the loop begins. Hence, we can use <code class="highlighter-rouge">Ptr2</code> instead of <code class="highlighter-rouge">Ptr3</code>, saving us one memory location.</p>

<p>That’s was interesting ain’t it?</p>

<p>One more thing I learned during the interview is the existance of a trie:

<p class="text-center text-gray lh-condensed-ultra f6">A trie | Source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie">Wikipedia</a></p>

<p>Which is helpful in search suggestions, especially if you have hundreds of thousands of such suggestions.</p>

<p>Well, I’ll probably not get what I interviewed for; but that’s fine. The experience taught me how it’s like to be interviewed for my technical skills; and helped me come up with possible strategies to try before my next interview.</p>

<p>Good luck for your own interviews, if they’re coming up!</p>

<p>Happy coding,</p>
