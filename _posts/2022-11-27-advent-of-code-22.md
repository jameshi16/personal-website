:coffee: Hi!

After having absolutely _zero_ blog posts for the past 11 months, including my treasured [anime](/anime) page, here I am declaring that I will be participating in the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) (AOC).

I've never completed an AOC before, so it'll be a nice challenge to breathe vitality into this blog before the New Years. To motivate me, I have invited my buddies over at [modelconverge](https://modelconverge.xyz) and [nikhilr](https://nikhilr.io) to join me.

Each of us will attempt each AOC, and discuss our solutions at the end of each week to judge each solution with its time-space complexity, and elegance. We will use any language we have at our disposal.

Throughout AOC, I will update this blog post in a rolling manner to discuss my thought processes from ideation to solution. Do check back every day!
