Are you perhaps living in a simulation? Perhaps some sort of higher entity is controlling you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I first watched Deca-Dence, I was expecting it to be something like &lt;a href=&quot;/anime/Shingeki-no-Kyojin/&quot;&gt;Shingeki no Kyojin&lt;/a&gt;, with all the post-apocalyptic hyping that the promotional video did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe style=&quot;display: block; margin: auto&quot; width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/OziblTliUbw&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-it-really-was&quot;&gt;What it really was&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This anime is a mix of existential crisis, epic giant battles, and the life of a girl in a post-apocalyptic world. For some, it is naught but a game; for others, it the matter of life and death. Would you put in your effort if you knew it didn’t matter in the end?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-actual-review&quot;&gt;The actual review&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t do my research beforehand, but I was surprised that Deca-Dence was animated by Nut, which is the same studio that animated &lt;a href=&quot;https://myanimelist.net/anime/32615/Youjo_Senki&quot;&gt;Youjo Senki&lt;/a&gt;. Perhaps the lack of distinction was due to how the characters are designed in Deca-Dence, but nevertheless, I couldn’t tell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless, the audiovisuals were good and complementary with one another - it is what I would expect of an anime made in 2020. Story-wise, I was surprised by the “setting twist” - which is a new term I shall coin for surprises similar to plot twists, but they happen in the settings instead of the plot (i.e. it wasn’t the progression of plot that surprised me, it was the scenario that surprised me).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even with the strange twist and turns around the scenario, the story remained shockingly consistent - in fact, the very last enemy had a clear backstory that was shown throughout the anime, with no need for flashbacks, or any story device explanations by any character in the anime. The methods for dealing with the enemies remained constant throughout, with variations only in the movements to deal damage, much like slicing the neck of a titan in Shingeki no Kyojin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Character development was evident throughout the entire story, making every episode feel fresh and exciting to watch. Battles were short, sweet and simple, so that the important plot elements can be introduced for plot progression purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, for an original anime created in 2020, Deca-Dence was quite a solid piece to watch. Give it a watch, I don’t think you’d regret it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy Coding&lt;/p&gt;

Of course I would be - it’s ufotable: famous for their unlimited budget works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I had to compare this movie to the previous installment of &lt;a href=&quot;/anime/Kimetsu-no-Yaiba/&quot;&gt;Kimetsu no Yaiba&lt;/a&gt;, it would be premium chocolate icing on well-baked sponge cake. In other words, the movie picked up the anime’s momentum perfectly, and preserved everything that made Kimetsu no Yaiba the one of the best hits in anime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;audiovisuals&quot;&gt;Audiovisuals&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As expected of ufotable, the visuals are stunning and communicates the story very well. Most scenes are well-complemented by the soundtrack, creating an ambiance to hook the user into the story. A testament to this is an emotional scene with Inosuke on set: ufotable was able to perfectly convey the emotions felt by a character who hides his face with a boar mask.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/20201115_2.png&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 400px; width: 100%; margin: 0 auto; display: block;&quot; alt=&quot;Inosuke Hashibira&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text-center text-gray lh-condensed-ultra f6&quot;&gt;Inosuke Hashibira | Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://kimetsu-no-yaiba.fandom.com/wiki/Inosuke_Hashibira&quot;&gt;Fandom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Real-life action movies usually have difficult-to-follow action scenes; they’re too fast paced for the eye to keep up. However, with the power of anime, slow-motion can be used to emphasize certain parts of the battle, which was done excellently in Kimetsu no Yaiba. Viewers are able to understand why certain actions performed by characters are considered impressive, or pivotal in a battle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that was done spectacularly were the dark scenes. During these scenes, the color adjusts to a grey-ish palette, which is a stark contrast to the usual bright palette used throughout the movie. This brings home the point that “oh, this is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; serious”, which primes the viewers to brace for a high-impact conflict and resolve between the characters in the movie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CGI used in the movie is not too overwhelming, and does not overshadow the animation. CGI is mostly used in the movie whenever an object needs to have a large range of motion in a short period of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;story&quot;&gt;Story&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do not read the manga, so I judge the story entirely based on the anime and the movie. Personally, I believe that there are too many reaction scenes - there would be a fight at one moment, and at the next moment, Tanjiro would gasp, or exclaim “oh no!”, or look on with shock. This is a traditional shounen anime troupe to show the emotions of the main character as the story progresses, but I think the movie can do better to cut down on these scenes, as they were quite distracting to the actual events transpiring in the scene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of actual events, some story elements to progress the plot were a little strange - it was not immediately clear how some characters managed to bypass the first conflict in the plot. It was also not clear why a direct solution the first conflict wouldn’t work, other than the main character going “I think solution X is a bad idea”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a shounen anime, the plotline was marginally predictable. However, I was surprised to find out that there were multiple climaxes to the movie - my surprise comes partly due to the PV only suggesting one major fight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe style=&quot;display:block; margin:auto&quot; width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/PrZ0O8Qp18s&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text-center text-gray lh-condensed-ultra f6 mt-3&quot;&gt;Kimetsu no Yaiba PV | Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrZ0O8Qp18s&quot;&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, the movie remained mostly consistent with the facts we learned from the anime, which made the movie easy to follow. Another factor that contributed to understanding the movie was the good pacing of the movie - viewers were slowly introduced to the quirks of the enemy, before a fast-paced action sequence to defeat the enemy, followed by a short cooldown for all the viewers to catch their breath, followed by the display of quirks of the next enemy, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of character building, the movie develops both Tanjiro and Rengoku. In Tanjiro’s case, information we already knew was used to develop his character further, by combining both his tragic backstory and the enemy’s quirk, strengthening the viewer’s knowledge of Tanjiro’s values and morals. In Rengoku’s case, flashbacks were used to show the goals, motivations, and ethics of Rengoku. Through Rengoku and the enemies, Zenitsu and Inosuke both received minor developments in the form of a mentor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kimetsu no Yaiba Movie: Mugen Ressha-hen is a great movie. If you have been a fan of the Kimetsu no Yaiba anime you should watch the movie. If you are a fan of the Kimetsu no Yaiba manga, you should still watch the movie just for the audiovisuals. If you have not watched Kimetsu no Yaiba, check out &lt;a href=&quot;/anime/Kimetsu-no-Yaiba/&quot;&gt;my review&lt;/a&gt;, and try to give both the anime and the movie a watch too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy coding&lt;/p&gt;

It is always nostalgic to see the end of a series, especially for an anime as iconic as “Shokugeki no Souma”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike the previous seasons - our characters are closer to their culinary peaks than ever, being unbridled in strength compared to their peers. This is what we see in the first two episodes, as the new Elite Ten basically flexes their skills over the rest of the students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the key joys of watching Shokugeki no Souma is seeing Souma being the underdog and overcoming challenges head-on, but in this anime, that aspect of the anime is overshadowed by a overpowering villainous backstory, weird creative liberties to prepare meals, and rushed relationship developments with very cliched flashbacks to boot. Moreover, the “clothes explosion” staple found in every “Shokugeki no Souma” anime gets out of hand in this season - the “PG13 or older” rating is definitely off by at least 3 years; while I would like to illustrate what I mean, I’d rather my blog remain SFW.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;step-by-step-guide-to-figure-out-who-wins-a-round-of-shokugeki-in-shokugeki-no-souma-gou-no-sara&quot;&gt;Step-by-step guide to figure out who wins a round of Shokugeki in “Shokugeki no Souma: Gou no Sara”&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Is he/she the last guy to present his/her dish?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If yes, he/she wins. If no, he/she loses.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;???&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Profit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The anime is extremely predictable; all you need to do is to keep the following facts in mind:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Souma is a main character, he cannot lose;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Unless the opponent is Erina, then he may lose.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If the main antagonist is involved without Souma, the antagonist wins.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If the main antagonist faces off the main character, then the main character wins.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Historic capabilities and expected growth does not matter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BAM, you can now guess the outcomes of any plot presented to you in the anime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;who-matters&quot;&gt;Who matters?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When watching the anime, you can tell that certain scenes exist solely to develop one aspect of a plot device used later in the anime. For example, there was a scene used specifically to highlight how powerful the antagonist’s clique was - they spent 9/10 of the entire episode on each member of the clique, how good their culinary skills were, and how easily they were able to pass challenges that other chefs cannot. Then, out of a sudden, “ok so the three of you from Totsuki also pass kekw” - this makes the scene seem narrow in purpose, and difficult to find engaging if not for the crazy styles of cooking shown in the episode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Souma, being the main character, also gets incredibly lucky on many occasions; for example, in one scene, he was given two chances to pass a challenge. He fails the first time, and uses the &lt;strong&gt;same&lt;/strong&gt; philosophy to pass the second time. In another instance, Souma basically gambled on fried rice to win a competition round, while the opponent loses despite being far more experience with culinary skills from all over the world - either Souma reached godhood, which contradicts his losing streak with his seniors, or somehow “dedicating cooking to someone” meant an automatic boost in cooking skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The anime actually covers two concurrent events, but only explains that by hurling a large info-dump towards the viewer at the end of the season. This could have been executed better, as it seems to imply that only the main character’s stories really matter. In fairness, it gives the side-characters alibis so that the story can be concluded in whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;villain-backstory--motivations&quot;&gt;Villain Backstory + Motivations&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I personally find the backstory and the (&lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt;) motivations of the villain quite cliched. I also don’t think that it justifies how the villain managed to gain the amount of power he did, and why he is so driven. There are not enough story elements to piece together the villain’s culinary growth into what is effectively a deity in the food world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;relationship-development&quot;&gt;Relationship development&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was no relationship development to speak of for 24 episodes; then suddenly, in episode 25, families reunite, love is in the air, and everyone is proud to be in the same generation as Souma &lt;em&gt;despite&lt;/em&gt; Souma not even being present for any relationship development to take place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just, how exactly did they go from enemies to family?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;flashbacks&quot;&gt;Flashbacks&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is way too many flashbacks in this season. Granted, the characters can’t exactly go through the other methods of character development otherwise, given the nature and premise of the anime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Shokugeki no Souma: Gou no Sara” is the finale season of the entire “Shokugeki no Souma” series. Hence, I appreciate its existence as a series closer - if you have watched “Shokugeki no Souma” religiously up till &lt;a href=&quot;/anime/Shokugeki-no-Souma-Shin-no-Sara/&quot;&gt;“Shokugeki no Souma: Shin no Sara”&lt;/a&gt;, then you should watch this anime as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The anime is lacking in terms of story quality based on the points I discussed above - ranging from predictability, to poor methods of character building, to the sheer plot armor Souma possess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless, the series as a whole has been phenomenal!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy Coding&lt;/p&gt;

Fresh from the oven (if fresh constitutes of a 10-day delay), we have the third season starring our beloved third-ranked Level 5 esper!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the failure that is “&lt;a href=&quot;/anime/A-Certain-Magical-Index-iii/&quot;&gt;A Certain Magical Index III&lt;/a&gt;”, many fans were disappointed by the incomprehensible finale due to it’s intense pacing and bad story-telling. Luckily for the anime, the saving grace that is “&lt;a href=&quot;/anime/Toaru-Kagaku-no-Accelerator/&quot;&gt;A Certain Scientific Accelerator&lt;/a&gt;” aired shortly after, making up for the bad taste left by “A Certain Magical Index III”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I first saw “A Certain Scientific Railgun T”’s PV video, I basically leaped out of my seat in excitement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;railgun&quot;&gt;Railgun&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me introduce you to everyone’s favourite tsundere biri-biri girl, Misaka Mikoto:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/20201005_1.gif&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 400px; width: 100%; margin: 0 auto; display: block;&quot; alt=&quot;rAiLgUn&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the “A Certain Magical Index” series, she’s seen as comedic relief, and sometimes supports the main character, although she usually fails to address the main problem because it’s magic on one end, and “&lt;em&gt;science&lt;/em&gt;” on the other. Unlike Kamijou Touma, and alike Accelerator, Misaka Mikoto lives on the side of science as one of the city’s top espers (yeah, “&lt;em&gt;science&lt;/em&gt;”).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her affection for the city, her friends and &lt;em&gt;some side effects&lt;/em&gt; causes her to blip in and out of the “dark side of the city”, which we see in greater detail in the anime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;vs-accelerator&quot;&gt;vs Accelerator&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both “A Certain Scientific Accelerator” and “A Certain Scientific Railgun” have overlapping settings, but as you can tell from both of my reviews (and the community’s rating on MyAnimeList), the clear favourite is “A Certain Scientific Railgun”. Why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me, the main reason is the &lt;strong&gt;shown&lt;/strong&gt; psychological level of conflict faced by both characters. On one hand, Accelerator is the top esper in the entire city, having enough power to absolutely crush the second-ranked esper &lt;em&gt;while&lt;/em&gt; being physically crippled. Even though he is no longer the able-bodied Accelerator, he &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; discovers a way to increase his powers, destroy his opponents and live happily ever after.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accelerator, being on top of law enforcement itself due to his sheer ability, faces no psychological conflicts after &lt;em&gt;a certain series of events involving a side effect of Misaka Mikoto&lt;/em&gt;, no social backlash, no troubles of common man, and no obligations to fulfill; other than to protect a certain someone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/20201005_2.gif&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 400px; width: 100%; margin: 0 auto; display: block;&quot; alt=&quot;A Certain Someone&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;text-center text-gray lh-condensed-ultra f6&quot;&gt;A Certain Someone | Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tumblr.com&quot;&gt;Tumblr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Railgun is considered “balanced” by being third-ranked. Being sandwhiched between Level 5 espers causes her to be closer to common man compared to Accelerator, which we do see reminders of in the anime: (i) just like the other students, she’s gravely afraid of the dorm fellow, (ii) she has an interest in Gekota, a mascot character of some sort, commonly seen as childish and (iii) she mostly follows the rules, even though she could probably be above them like the other Level 5s if she wanted to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These limiters, combined with her simple philosophy of “if you hurt my friends or my city, I’ll make you pay”, makes her story intriguing; in one of the episodes, she is &lt;em&gt;limited&lt;/em&gt; by sticking to the rules, which resulted in her friends getting hurt one way or another. As a viewer, you’ll feel frustrated as you watch the anime, and think something along the lines of: “If Misaka was there, this incident would be over in a heartbeat, and no one would have been hurt”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;other-reasons-why-a-certain-scientific-railgun-t-is-good&quot;&gt;Other reasons why A Certain Scientific Railgun T is good&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve got to say, “A Certain Scientific Railgun”’s supporting cast is top-tier. There are two reasons why I think so: (i) Railgun has a top-tier clique and (ii) the rare interaction between &lt;em&gt;individuals&lt;/em&gt; from the dark side and the light side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine a team comprising of a teleporter, a railgun, a hacker and a 6th sensor, all trained to trust and support each other. It’s quite unimaginable, innit? The teleporter-railgun duo has gotten so popular that it became a saying within the “A Certain Magical Index” series:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe height=&quot;315&quot; style=&quot;margin: 10px auto; max-width: 560px; width: 100%; display: block;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/echT7Ymj3-g&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Railgun T also shows the rare interaction between two characters from different sides of the city - one from the light side, and the other from the dark side. This is interesting because if you have watched the other anime within the main series, these characters appear outright villainous with sadistic personalities and seem to hate life itself. It’s quite refreshing knowing that these villains are still human at heart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One more thing other than the top-tier supporting cast is the interesting and creative story-telling devices. I won’t go too much into it because of the spoilers, but whenever I see these devices, I think: “Is this another episode of Doraemon?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“A Certain Scientific Railgun T” is a wonderful anime. It has good visuals, sound, an epic opening (the first one’s from fripSide, it literally cannot be bad), and  an engaging story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve already watched the other Toaru-series anime, watch this one too. You definitely don’t want to miss it, and it doesn’t even cost you a lot of time (25 episodes * 20 minutes per episode == 8 hours 20 minutes, just sacrifice your sleeping schedule and breakfast and you’re good).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve never watched the Toaru anime, I recommend you to start from “A Certain Magical Index” (I to III), and then “A Certain Scientific Accelerator”, then all three “A Certain Scientific Railgun” anime. It’ll only take you about a week, just ignore your responsibilities!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Note: Some remarks are satire. Satirical identification is left for the reader as an exercise.&lt;/p&gt;

The final installment of the Heaven’s Feel route, arguably the best route of Fate/stay night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a long-time Fate fan (minus the Visual Novel, bite me), I inevitably spoiled parts of the Heaven’s Feel trilogy for myself, long before Ufotable announced an adaptation. That being said, the last time I watched a Fate/stay night series was &lt;a href=&quot;/anime/Fate-stay-night-Movie-Heavens-Feel-II-Lost-Butterfly/&quot;&gt;back in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, and I’ve forgotten most of the story that transpired in the first and second installment of the trilogy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hence, here are my two cents for those who want to watch Heaven’s Feel - III. Spring Song: re-watch the first and second movie in the trilogy. This trilogy is so much better binged, as one would be more emotionally connected to the characters and better understand the struggles they face in Heaven’s Feel - III. Spring Song.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From this point on, let me proclaim that this review would have some spoilers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;ufotable&quot;&gt;Ufotable&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While you’re not looking, Ufotable can probably deploy a pro-money EX rank Reality Marble to create unlimited budget productions complete with god-level art, convincing sound effects and attention-grabbing voice acting. For those uninitiated, Ufotable is the studio that animated &lt;a href=&quot;/anime/Kimetsu-no-Yaiba/&quot;&gt;Kimetsu no Yaiba&lt;/a&gt; and some notable Fate franchise series like Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works and Fate/Zero.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is therefore not a stretch to say that this movie was &lt;em&gt;artful&lt;/em&gt;. This time, there was not much in the way of flashy lights and epic battles like in II. Lost Butterfly; instead, the atmosphere and vital story elements were greatly emphasized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;(Spoilers) For example, when Tohsaka Rin was tossing the Zeltrech Jeweled Sword heirloom to Matou Sakura during their battle, the scene was in slow motion. It emphasized the fact that Rin was throwing away one of her only advantages, especially after a speech about how one sister had to suffer while the other lived a “blessed” life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;(Spoilers) Emiya Shirou’s night scenes, Kotomine Kirei’s church and the Greater Grail’s location were all great examples of amazing atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sound effects in III. Spring Song was top-notch and on-point. You’d find yourself in a super loud scene, only for it to become deafeningly quiet to emphasize something on-screen, like somebody dodging something, or the sound of a blade cutting through flesh, or a scene where someone detects the presence of a Servant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The voice acting was great. I was already convinced about this after a certain Matou Sakura scene in II. Lost Butterfly ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°), but being able to convey emotions coherent with the struggles of the character is powerful when capturing attention from the viewers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;type-moon-story&quot;&gt;Type-Moon Story&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some gripes I had for the story illustrated by the movie (spoilers):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Artoria was able to easily mana burst her way out of Medusa’s Mystic Eyes of Petrification. These were Jewel-ranked Mystic Eyes that are so excessively powerful that required sealing so that she doesn’t just petrify random folk on the street, or, in the worst case scenario, her own master. While Artoria had A++ mana, she had already started the petrification process - there shouldn’t be a way to stop this effect. I almost uttered “what the heck” out loud when I saw this;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Medusa was no longer able to use Mystic Eyes of Petrification afterwards, despite having her eyes open;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The time allocated to explain the power of Nine Lives Blade Works was way too short. In other routes, the full-blown Archer was unable to take all nine lives of Hercules, but somehow, in III. Spring Song, a Shirou with an Archer arm manages to do so with a few swings. While I understand Shirou’s internal daydream with Archer as he utilizes Archer’s arms (he surpasses Archer temporarily), Hercules is a beast of a Servant and shouldn’t be so easily defeated;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Why did it take so long to get the key of the Holy Grail? Where’s Sakura during all that?;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Illyasviel von Einzbern succumbed way too quickly to Emiya Shirou’s Harem Protagonist EX skill;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What motivation did Kotomine Kirei have when he helped Emiya Shirou? Was it just curiosity?;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Seems way too convenient that Zabinya only works on very particular hearts, which includes the hearts of many people EXCEPT Kotomine Kirei due to some plot-filler involving Gilgamesh being incorruptible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having these gripes does not redirect my focus on the best parts of the story though: (i) consequences are real, (ii) inner struggles are real and should never be undermined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;(Spoilers) The trilogy depicts the True End for the Heaven’s Feel route. In this ending, Illyasviel uses the Third Magic (guess the name of this magic, it’s in the title) to save Shirou’s soul, which completely dissociates him from his body. With the help of Touko Aozaki, another character in the Nasuverse, his soul is placed into a doll and the crew live happily ever after with no revives. Shirou doesn’t get revived with his real body, the Matou family is dead, and sadly, Illyasviel doesn’t come back. Consequences are mostly actually consequences, which makes the ending more satisfying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;(Spoilers) The entire trilogy is about inner struggles, especially revolving about Shirou’s aspirations to become an Ally of Justice vs saving Sakura, an enemy of Justice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the spoilers haven’t driven you away from watching the movie, you should most definitely give the entire trilogy a shot. Despite some problems with the story, I love the Fate franchise too much to pick on the technicalities based on my vastly useless knowledge from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://typemoon.fandom.com/wiki/Heaven%27s_Feel_(route)&quot;&gt;TypeMoon Wikia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Ufotable has an unbeatable EX rank pro-money Reality Marble for a Noble Phantasm, you should still watch Fate/stay night Movie Heaven’s Feel III. Spring Song from your local cinema :video_camera:; good anime should always be appreciated as an investment for even better anime in the future!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy Coding&lt;/p&gt;

Then I looked at the genres.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Eh? Where’s the drama tag? Or the romance tag?”, I say as I tried cross-referencing the cover with the genre tags, as if trying to find a connection between two seemingly unrelated suspects in a convoluted murder case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-i-loved-about-toilet-bound-hanako-kun&quot;&gt;What I loved about Toilet-bound Hanako-kun&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I loved the unique style the anime uses to perform story-telling. Instead of animating the whole thing, they make use of still frames to present information, which works very well with the light-hearted side of the anime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also liked how the anime keeps the viewers on their toes whenever secondary information (i.e. information through gossip) is presented - there is always more than meets the eye. Keeping the viewer constantly guessing is a sure-fire way to retain engagement, alongside the constant flipping between light-hearted daily occurrences, mystery and action elements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visually speaking, the art style is cutesy and easy to look at, serving as a contrasting point to the darker elements within the anime. It’s kind of like “gap-moe” but for story-telling. It is very easy to discern when a moment is supposed to be cute, or emotional and heavy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Extra points:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the voice-acting; they’re pretty much on-point.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the storyline was enjoyable to watch and easy to digest.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;relationship between characters were well-defined and is logical due to circumstances.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-i-think-could-be-improved&quot;&gt;What I think could be improved&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Toilet-bound Hanako-kun was great, with every episode having a problem that requires resolution. However, the progress towards reaching the underlying plot’s “main goal” or “main conflict” is moving at a tortoise’s pace - in fact, I believe that the first “real” conflict hasn’t even been resolved yet, despite the long 12 episodes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is fine to perfect the environment around which the main story takes place, but taking too long might cause the viewers to forget they aren’t actually watching a slice-of-life anime. I had to keep telling myself that: “no, this is not a slice-of-life anime, there’s a deeper lore here” whenever I encounter a plot device for the main plot as I watched the anime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, I can’t wait to see what Season 2 of “Toilet-bound Hanako-kun” brings to the table. There is room for even more character development for our main cast, which I believe can only progress should the climax of the main plot present itself in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Give “Toilet-bound Hanako-kun” a watch!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy Coding&lt;/p&gt;

You know what, I like Gakkougurashi. Not because the girls are cute, or the background is particularly interesting, but because of the character dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each and every one of these characters are fighting for survival both physically, and mentally. They all dependent on each other as a team, and losing even one of them would have detrimental effects on team morale and survival. The plot involves keeping a person insane (yes, as in mentally unwell) to brighten up their lives during long periods of isolation. That’s genius.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the characters have clearly defined roles with predictable personalities and sad backstories, but yet contribute in their own meaningful way towards achieving the common goal of “survive”, and “find survivors”. It’s nothing as grandiose as “save the world”, but it is nevertheless an engaging experience as we explore the world and characters of Gakkogurashi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one of the few anime that forced me to read the manga to find out the rest of the story - the character development, world building and plot progression &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; the anime is absolutely bonkers. In the manga, the ending is wonderfully executed, putting a closure to an anime that I never thought I would like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hence, for a full experience, watch the anime, then read the manga. It’ll only take you a day if you binge it all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy Coding&lt;/p&gt;

This time, there’s no OP hero, but a girl obsessed with books.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet another combination that seems to work well; the execution salvaged the anime from my original perception that “this is just another isekai anime, I don’t really want to watch it”. Do note that I lied in my previous paragraph, about the “OP” part. You’ll see what I mean if you watch the anime till the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the remainder of the anime, we see that the main character try to hide her identity as she “invents” new products that she brought over from her old world, set a goal for her entrepreneurship ideals, but give it up for a more realistic plan that factored in her very (second) life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a nutshell, this was a refreshing watch; a young girl with the tendencies of a entrepreneur in another world is a concept you simply don’t experience often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those uninitiated, Fate is hands down my favourite series. Hence, I didn’t really care that I knew the entire plot from playing the game, and still watched the anime like a true devout follower of the Fate franchise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I loved every part of it; although, the technicalities of the last battle with Tiamat was, in my book, impossible. Hence, I docked a point, but otherwise this anime would have gotten a 10/10 rating from me. Not biased, of course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t wait for the other adaptations for Camelot and Solomon, they’re going to be &lt;em&gt;epic&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And well, Boku no Hero 4th season was a pretty good season; we even got a cliffhanger at the end to build suspense for the next season. The most memorable moment in the season was probably the climax scene; one can say that the aftermath caused a reshuffling of the cast cabinet, and the dynamics of the characters has changed somewhat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s see what Season 5 has got in store for us.&lt;/p&gt;
