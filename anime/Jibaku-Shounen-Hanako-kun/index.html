    <p>My first impressions of “Toilet-bound Hanako-kun” was “ah, this is going to be another one of those romance anime where drama will ensue on who gets the girl and whatnot”. Then I looked at the genres.</p>

<p>“Eh? Where’s the drama tag? Or the romance tag?”, I say as I tried cross-referencing the cover with the genre tags, as if trying to find a connection between two seemingly unrelated suspects in a convoluted murder case.</p>

<h1 id="what-i-loved-about-toilet-bound-hanako-kun">What I loved about Toilet-bound Hanako-kun</h1>

<p>I loved the unique style the anime uses to perform story-telling. Instead of animating the whole thing, they make use of still frames to present information, which works very well with the light-hearted side of the anime.</p>

<p>I also liked how the anime keeps the viewers on their toes whenever secondary information (i.e. information through gossip) is presented - there is always more than meets the eye. Keeping the viewer constantly guessing is a sure-fire way to retain engagement, alongside the constant flipping between light-hearted daily occurrences, mystery and action elements.</p>

<p>Visually speaking, the art style is cutesy and easy to look at, serving as a contrasting point to the darker elements within the anime. It’s kind of like “gap-moe” but for story-telling. It is very easy to discern when a moment is supposed to be cute, or emotional and heavy.</p>

<p>Extra points:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the voice-acting; they’re pretty much on-point.</li>
  <li>the storyline was enjoyable to watch and easy to digest.</li>
  <li>relationship between characters were well-defined and is logical due to circumstances.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="what-i-think-could-be-improved">What I think could be improved</h1>

<p>Toilet-bound Hanako-kun was great, with every episode having a problem that requires resolution. However, the progress towards reaching the underlying plot’s “main goal” or “main conflict” is moving at a tortoise’s pace - in fact, I believe that the first “real” conflict hasn’t even been resolved yet, despite the long 12 episodes.</p>

<p>It is fine to perfect the environment around which the main story takes place, but taking too long might cause the viewers to forget they aren’t actually watching a slice-of-life anime. I had to keep telling myself that: “no, this is not a slice-of-life anime, there’s a deeper lore here” whenever I encounter a plot device for the main plot as I watched the anime.</p>

<h1 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h1>

<p>Nevertheless, I can’t wait to see what Season 2 of “Toilet-bound Hanako-kun” brings to the table. There is room for even more character development for our main cast, which I believe can only progress should the climax of the main plot present itself in the near future.</p>

<p>Give “Toilet-bound Hanako-kun” a watch!</p>

<p>Happy Coding</p>
