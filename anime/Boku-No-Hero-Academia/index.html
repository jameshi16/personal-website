    <p><strong>Warning</strong>: This reviews Season 1 thorugh Season 3. This review was written 2 months after I watched it, so I don’t remember half of what happened in the series, although I can generally tell you why it’s pretty good.</p>

<p>I have never been a die-hard fan of pure shounen shows - they’re usually my “side-quest” anime whenever I stockpile anime to watch. Boku no Hero Academia hasn’t changed my mind about how I view shounen show, but it was quite enjoyable to watch. It follows a boy named “Midoriya”, who wants to be a hero but lacks the ability to do so, as he was born unlike others with natural quirks.</p>

<p>While I would like to say hard work and perseverance paid off and he finally was able to become a hero, I would argue it is not entirely true - it’s like Rikkudo Senin granting Naruto his Six Paths power. Sure, Naruto worked hard to get to where he was before the power boost, but it does not change the fact that he simply “got” a power boost as a gift from someone else. Midoriya in Boku no Hero Academia gains a power boost on similar terms, making it difficult to comprehend and resonate with as a character.</p>

<p>Hence, while this anime is enjoyable for the fights, and the characte development, the base of the characters are difficult to resonate with, making it difficult to feel emotional about the anime. But, well, it’s a shounen show, so you should enjoy it like a shounen show. Don’t expect too much, just enjoy it!</p>

<p>Happy Coding,</p>
